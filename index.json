By utilizing that phenomena, our research group has been developing \u0026ldquo;Metal nanosheet gas sensors\u0026rdquo;.\nMetal nanosheets have many advantages for sensor application over other materials such as metal semiconductor oxides and polymers.\n Sensor size is small (\u0026lt; 0.01 cm2), so easy to integrate. Reduction of power consumption is possible (\u0026lt; 0.1 mW) by utilizing self-heating effect (see this paper as an example). Highly sensitive because of the catalysis. Highly stable if choose noble metals as materials.  We have already realized the multimolecule detection of hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3) by integration of Pt and PtRh nanosheet sensors with a power consumption of less than 1 mW (See ref).\n  The goal of this research is that we realize metal nanosheets sensor systems which can accurately measure five or more types of low molecules in air or in breath.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634083200,"objectID":"9371efafcc71405d9fcc167c5f99e185","permalink":"https://tarokato3.github.io/post/integrated_metal_nanosheet_gas_sensor/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/integrated_metal_nanosheet_gas_sensor/","section":"post","summary":"One of my research themes","tags":["Metal nanosheet","Gas sensor"],"title":"Metal nanosheet gas sensors","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ryo Toyoshima","Takahisa Tanaka","Taro Kato","Ken Uchida","Hiroshi Kondoh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595289600,"objectID":"0fbbfef8d4441cb4b2ea09f3239c1368","permalink":"https://tarokato3.github.io/publication/toyoshima2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/toyoshima2020/","section":"publication","summary":"It is found that scatterings of electrons in metal nanosheets by adsorbed molecules depend on temperature.","tags":[],"title":"In situ AP-XPS analysis of a Pt thin-film sensor for highly sensitive H2 detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taro KATO"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"Introduction movies   --\r  ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"ee9513dd446a58ca108b2abff14ef344","permalink":"https://tarokato3.github.io/post/about_our_group/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/about_our_group/","section":"post","summary":"Please check out!","tags":["Metal nanosheet","Gas sensor"],"title":"Introduction of the research in our group (Japanese video)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"b2a2eb2f1d9dd8b528d3017ab7a2fd40","permalink":"https://tarokato3.github.io/project/tanaka2021/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tanaka2021/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Simulation"],"title":"Example Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://tarokato3.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
